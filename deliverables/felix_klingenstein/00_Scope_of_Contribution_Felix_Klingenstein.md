# OGAP – Scope of Contribution
Felix Klingenstein - 35132522

This part of the project focuses on the product conception and technical realization of OGAP.

My deliverables include the development of the product vision and scope, the design and documentation of the system architecture, and the hands-on implementation of the core application logic, including frontend components, backend integration, and realtime interaction flows.
This comprises the conceptual design of the real-time parking coordination and handshake mechanism, the credit-based incentive system, and their technical implementation within the web application.

In addition, I produced the technical and analytical documentation describing architectural decisions, system workflows, assumptions, limitations, and evaluation criteria. The delivered artifacts cover the product concept, the implemented application, and the supporting documentation required to assess the solution from both a product and engineering perspective.
